<h1>To Do, using Jquery</h1>

Yes, another JavaScript To Do app.

I tried to do some MVC structure, but I don't really know if it breaks down that easily like that.

Some features/code taken from the ToDoMVC project.

Features Roadmap:
1. Better design/UI

2. Totally delete items from list(s)

3. Local storage options

4. Add support for multiple lists with topics?
